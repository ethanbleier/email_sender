# Our mission is to amplify your reach with GMAIL
A close friend of mine once said he needed a service that could send out cusomized marketing emails for free, so I offered to try and take a crack at it and eventually sold him a script that was like, barely scraping by, but technically checked off enough criteria to be useful, and therefor valuable.

I was proud of it then, but a few details bothered me. And I have new ideas.

__GOALS:__\
_Long Term:_ something shippable; something I'm proud of\
_Short Term:_ refine a useful and easily sharable niche service
